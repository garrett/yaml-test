      Django is a high-level Python based web framework that encourages rapid
      development and clean, pragmatic design.

      Django comes with it's very own templating layer, which is not merely python
      embedded into HTML, but it is a dumb python-like DSL which, by design, keeps
      programming logic out of the templates and keeps the presentation layer
      clean.

      In this talk, Shreyank will introduce the Django Template Language and cover
      most of the useful tags and filters. He will also explore how to write
      custom tags and filters. For more information, including speaker bio, [visit

      Whether you like it or loath it, Java the language and Java the platform
      have set the standard for enterprise computing for over a decade and don't
      look like giving up that top spot for a while yet. However, we continue to
      hear complaints about the complexity of developing applications with Java
      and it is no secret that J2EE wasn't always the easiest beast to conquer.
      Various frameworks sprang up over the years to try to simplify the lives of
      Java enterprise developers, such as Seam and Spring, and with the advent of
      Java Enterprise Edition 6 (EE6) and changes in the JVM to allow non-Java
      languages to be supported, we are starting to see a renaissance. In this
      presentation we will look at some of the things that have happened in the
      last few years that have already increased the productivity of enterprise
      Java development, including key features like CDI in EE6 and changes in the
      Java Community Process. We'll illustrate some of this with the new release
      of the JBoss Application Server, AS7, which is a full EE6 compliant
      application server yet is fast, modular and lightweight. We'll also look at
      some other advancement that are happening in open source that will also help
      and which may make their way into the standards.

      The myth of Java EE as a cumbersome platform is easily dispelled in this
      session, which aims to create a working application, from a blank repository
      to a live cloud deployment, in real time. It \* Covers tools that bootstrap
      project creation, freeing you from mucking around with Maven POM boilerplate
      \* Generates a domain model and reverse-engineers JPA entities from it \*
      Automatically creates the scaffolding for tests that run in a real Java EE
      container, launched from the IDE \* Pushes it all to production on a public
      site

      Using a variety of projects from the JBoss Community adhering to and
      building upon open standards, this presentation can create real enterprise
      apps in the time it takes other sessions to click through some slides. Let’s
      get building!

      Key concepts of reliable distributed computing developed during the ’80s and
      ’90s, such as transactions and replication, have influenced Java EE.
      However, the way enterprises are using networked computing for businesses is
      undergoing rapid changes as new ways of constructing distributed execution
      environments from various resources—ranging from computational, storage, and
      network to application-level services provided by globally distributed
      service providers—are emerging. In light of these developments, this session
      examines what core concepts, components, and techniques will be required in
      the Java middleware of the future.

      starting with Java EE 7. The focus of Java EE 7 and 8 is mostly on the
      cloud, specifically aiming to bring platform as a service (PaaS) providers
      and application developers together so that portable applications can be
      deployed on any cloud infrastructure and reap all its benefits in terms of
      scalability, elasticity, multitenancy, and so on. Most importantly, Java EE
      will leverage the modularization work in the underlying Java SE platform.
      Java EE will, of course, also update itself for trends such as HTML5,
      caching, NoSQL, ployglot programming, map/reduce, JSON, REST, and
      improvements to existing core APIs.

      Using a Web application is easy. Testing it should be easy as well.
      Arquillian, a revolutionary Java enterprise testing platform—together with
      its extensions Arquillian Drone and Arquillian Android—enables that. In this
      tutorial, you will learn how to integrate existing testing frameworks such
      as JUnit with the Web testing tool Selenium. It also leverages the Maven
      infrastructure of a project. Whatever technology you are using to create Web
      pages, wherever the application is deployed, and whatever browser—including
      mobile ones—you are using, configuring a test environment is a matter of
      minutes. Do not spend time with configuration; skip right to writing Web

      In modern development environments, it’s a must to include testing of Web
      applications as a standard part of the development lifecycle. Such tests can
      also be used as acceptance criteria in enterprise projects. Although full
      automation is possible, it is considered to be very expensive. As a result,

    The Boston Summit is a three-day hackfest for GNOME developers and
    contributors. It is not primarily aimed at users or new contributors, but if
    you want to jump right into the deep end, it's a fantastic way to meet
    everyone and get involved. Unlike traditional conferences, the Boston Summit
    is all about getting developers together and getting things done. While
    there are some non-hacking sessions, they are geared heavily towards
    many-to-many, interactive discussion and planning, rather than one-to-many
    presentations. However, unlike previous years, there are plans to run in
    parallel a more newbie-oriented set of sessions, such as a basic Linux/GNOME
    "installfest" and help learning about GNOME application technologies.

    Many Red Hat employees who are contributors to GNOME will be in attendance.

      Common Build Infrastracture (CBI) is an landscape-changing initiative to
      make builds easy for everyone. The technologies that are used in that build
      system are relatively young in the Eclipse environment, however, they'd been
      already adopted in a number of not-only-eclipse projects.

      Eclipse Platform to Maven/Tycho conversion is the most difficult example of
      adoption, mostly due to the fact that its build system was created in
      ancient days of Eclipse creation, and it hardly can be mapped to current
      maven concepts.

      In this talk, Mickael and Krzysztof will present their experiences that they
      had gathered while working on CBI and JBoss Tools (and a few others) build
      projects, which include:

      - the general concept of Tycho/Maven
      - common signs that you'll have problems migrating to Tycho

      It is common knowledge that some developers swear by using command-line
      tools to do their job. Typing quickly, the use of tabbed completion and
      running scripts are key ingredients to their productivity. Nevertheless a
      fancy IDE such as Eclipse also attracts many developers. These love to rely
      on key benefits such as incremental building, form based editing, outline
      views and navigating the workspace. Well, we have some excellent news for
      developers that want the best of both worlds.

      JBoss Forge is a command-line driven open source tool that enables users to
      adopt an incremental approach to their daily Java development. It lets you
      take an existing Java project and safely add in new functionality. Whether
      you want to set up JSF, use persistence or create REST endpoints, it all
      becomes a real breeze. Forge was created with extensibility in mind and is
      completely technology agnostic.

      The good news that was mentioned above is that a number of Eclipse plugins
      bring this power right to the heart of your favorite IDE. Just think about a
      command-line tool nicely integrated in an Eclipse view. Now imagine that the
      commmands issued at this command-line tool are immediately reflected with
      changes and useful feedback in your workbench... Doesn't that sound cool?

      In this talk, Koen will show this powerful integration between IDE and
      command-line at work. He will highlight many of the benefits as well as some
      of the more advanced possibilities of this approach. Come to this talk if
      you want to know how to take advantage of all this power.

  - summary: Kick your Java EE development up a notch with m2e-wtp
    speaker: Fred Bricon

    description: |-
      The m2e-wtp project is a new project incubating at the Eclipse foundation.
      Built upon the popular m2eclipse-wtp plugin, it aims at providing a tight
      integration between the Eclipse’s Web Tools Platform and m2e, the Maven
      Integration plugin for Eclipse.

      In this heavily demo-focused presentation, Fred will show you how you can
      bring powerful Maven capabilities to your legacy Eclipse Java EE
      applications, detailing 3 features m2e-wtp adds over your typical WTP
      installation:

      - Convert your Eclipse projects to Maven : taking advantage of the new
      Eclipse to Maven Conversion API added in m2e 1.1, m2e-wtp translates your
      WTP project settings (Web, EJB, EAR ...) to their equivalent maven plugin
      configurations in a jiffy.
      - web resource filtering : lets you dynamically change the content of your
      web resources (web pages, css files, deployment descriptors...) using
      placeholders much like a templating engine. This allows you, for instance,
      to enable or disable debug parameters in your web.xml depending on some
      specific Maven profiles.
      - war overlays : ever needed to share the same web resources (images, css
      ...) across different web applications? The Maven war overlay mechanism
      allows you to define these common files in one location (be it a workspace
      project or a war archive) and let other web applications consume them
      without the need to duplicate them into their source control system

      Autotest (autotest.github.com) is a framework for fully automated kernel
      testing, although it works fine for userspace bits as well. In this
      presentation, we'll discuss the strategies and techniques you can use to
      deploy a fully automated test farm, with periodic or per-commit test jobs,
      with bare metal machine provisioning, console control and VM testing. For
      embedded farms we need a different approach, which will be discussed as
      well. The presentation consists in slides and a demo using virtual machines
      on the presenter's laptop.

      The tutorial will provide a hands-on introduction to FreeIPA - an integrated
      identity management solution. The FreeIPA project brings together several
      industry-proven technologies such as LDAP or Kerberos. Easy-to-use
      installation scripts and both command line and browser-based interfaces make
      previously complex task of rolling out enterprise identity management easy,
      scalable and accessible.

      We'll demonstrate the installation, setup and several tasks such as user
      management or establishing a trust setup with an Active Directory domain.
      We'll also show the advantages of using the SSSD for client machines, like
      the ability to access identity servers offline.

      The tutorial is mainly targeted at system administrators. Rudimentary
      knowledge of technologies such as LDAP is advantageous, but not required. A
      VM image based on Fedora 18 will be available for the attendance to
      experiment easily.

      SSD devices promise a lot - very high random IO rates, high performance
      streaming IO and different failure modes than traditional storage. SSD
      devices are still considerably more expensive than traditional storage, so
      multiple projects have worked to use SSD's as a cache for cheaper and denser
      traditional storage.

      This panel will have developers from several SSD caching projects - file

      When I was a kid, the computer was my favorite toy. I would spend hours of

      anything becomes a job it is difficult to stay in love with it even when
      your job is open source.

      So, find a hobby? Do something else! That's great, but for me nothing has
      the same mental reward as a good computer project. It just sucks to
      constantly be at the mercy of other people's demands... My solution has been
      simple: retro-computing! I don't just use the computers of my youth, I make
      them do interesting new things! It's crazy, of course...but I love it! Maybe
      hearing about my experiences could be useful for you to find your way to

      The real-time patch (which provides CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT), has been around
      since 2005. Started by Ingo Molnar and maintained by Thomas Gleixner and
      several others, it has grown from a hobby RTOS into a very serious
      contender. Several distributions (Red Hat, SuSE, Debian, Ubuntu) supply a
      kernel version that includes this patch. The embedded world has started
      adding the -rt patch to their own devices that they ship. But do the
      embedded developers understand what the -rt patch supplies? Programming for
      real time, and especially when writing kernel code requires special
      knowledge to avoid real time traps. This talk will explain what the real
      time patch provides and special programming tips that will ensure embedded
      developers will get the best from their devices.

      In this session we cover two aspects of live migration:

      - We discuss the work of moving the execution of outgoing live migration to
      a separate dedicated thread in QEMU.
      - Using a separate thread for live migration reduces contention with the IO
      thread and vcpus which results in higher throughput and more reliable
      downtime.

      We analyze Live Migration performance state:

      - Performance on very large guests and the issues we encounter with such a
      guest. This discussion will include convergence and actual downtime
      (compared to user configured downtime).
      - Live migration effects on the running guest (downtime and performance
      impact on the guest workload)
      - Resource consumption (network bandwidth and CPU usage)

      Historically most usage of virtualization has focused on running entire
      operating systems in virtual machines or containers. The libvirt-sandbox
      toolkit builds on libvirt, KVM & LXC, to provide a high level API and
      command line tools to facilitate the use of virtualization as a technology
      for creating secure application sandboxes, without the burden of maintaining
      additional OS installations. The talk will cover the architecture of the
      sandbox technology, the challenges faced in its design & implementation, use
      cases it can address and the scope for future development.

      The talk is suitable for a broad audience, covering system administrators,
      application developers & virtualization platform developers. A basic
      understanding of virtualization and security concepts is assumed. The
      audience will learn what capabilities the API & tools provide & how they can
      be applied to their environment.

      KVM autotest is a large set of functional and performance tests for KVM
      (both kernel and userspace). The design goals of the project were to provide
      infrastructure to perform extensive and systematic tests, and it's largely
      considered a QA only affair.

      However, during the last couple of years, we've been working on bringing the
      benefits of this flexible test framework for developers, a fundamentally
      different use case. This required re-thinking the structure of the project.

      This presentation aims to show the work that has been done in making the
      tests more approachable and useable for KVM developers:

      - Separation of tests from autotest core
      - Exposing APIs for convenient use on external test scripts
      - Abstract concepts that are not entirely necessary for a casual developer
      to make use of autotest (such as configuration files)

      oVirt web administration application (WebAdmin) is a powerful tool to manage
      various assets of the virtualization infrastructure. In addition to existing
      functionality, there can be times when administrators want to expose
      additional features of their infrastructure through WebAdmin user interface.

      In this session, Vojtech will present the concept and implementation of UI
      plugins, upcoming oVirt feature that allows third-party developers to extend
      WebAdmin user interface and related functionality. UI plugins integrate with
      WebAdmin directly on the client through JavaScript programming language,
      which makes the plugin infrastructure simple and flexible.

      Attend this session to learn more about UI plugins, update on current
      implementation, and live demo showing how to write and deploy custom plugin.
      This session is intended for anyone interested in extending oVirt WebAdmin
      functionality.

      QEMU's original memory API, was complicated, hard to use, incorrect,
      insecure, did not scale, and consumed a lot of memory. None of these was
      particularly problematic with the original use cases of emulating embedded
      boards, or perhaps running a virtualized desktop system to use "the other
      OS". However, for enterprise and cloud users running hundreds of untrusted
      guests on a single host, the API and its implementation presents a problem.

      This talk will cover the new QEMU memory API, its design considerations, and
      how it addresses the limitations of the old implementation.

      QEMU (and hence KVM) has long supported thin provisioning, through both
      sparse raw files and image formats such as qcow2. However, there are several
      limitations in the implementation of this feature, which make it much less
      effective as the lifetime of a virtual machine image grows. This talk will
      cover how thin provisioning can help both virtual machine and host
      administrators, as well as when/how it can be used now. It will also present
      a plan for making this feature more generally, effectively and easily
      usable.

      This talk is aimed at system administrators and developers. While relevant
      concepts will be introduced during the talk, some familiarity with storage
      technology is expected.

      This talk gives an overview of GlusterFS for scale-out storage management of
      KVM disk images. GlusterFS creates network attached storage on commodity
      hardware, including features for elastically adding/removing nodes and
      georeplication. Recent improvements in GlusterFS and KVM make it easy to run
      VM disk images on GlusterFS volumes. We also focus on GlusterFS architecture
      and how it could be extended for virtualization-specific needs.

      Previous experience with KVM or GlusterFS is not necessary, but a general
      understanding of virtualization and disk images is required. Users of NFS

      of developers contributing to each release. OpenStack's success - and the
      potential for it to be deployed pervasively at massive scale, particularly
      in public clouds - presents an opportunity for KVM's continued growth and
      adoption.

      Mark, a former KVM developer, will introduce the OpenStack project, its
      architecture and current status. Mark will then talk in some detail about
      how OpenStack currently uses KVM and libvirt before setting the scene for a

      The VM scheduler is the heart of a private cloud, it selects host for your
      virtual machine, decides about VM migrations and aligns the load on the
      hosts. While this is not a simple task, performance and the costs of the
      virtualization system is largely dependent on the decisions this component
      makes. JBoss Drools can help us to make the decision logic more readable and
      easier to extend by specifying rules rather than trying to rewrite an
      existing algorithm. This approach promises better performance for your
      private could through better decisions.

      various mechanisms like:

      - GlusterFS's FUSE based native protocol
      - Qemu and libglusterfsclient

      Details on how both file and block based interfaces can be presented to host
      KVM images from GlusterFS will be provided.

      The presentation will then talk about how oVirt can be used to provision
      GlusterFS volumes and how such volumes can then be used for hosting KVM
      images. Configuration details of both these features from oVirt would be

      Getting started with Java EE development can, despite the important
      improvements over time, still be quite daunting for newbies. Putting a JSF
      application to work, setting up persistence or enabling restful web services
      are not trivial tasks.

      JBoss Forge is a versatile and lean development environment entirely written
      in Java and making smart use of CDI. Its purpose is to offer you the
      possibility of incrementally working in new functionality into existing Java
      projects. It is a command-line oriented tool, so creating entities or
      scaffolding a user interface is just a matter of issuing a few commands.

      But what if your task cannot be done by Forge? No worries, as Forge operates
      by means of plug-ins, the answer is simply to look for an appropriate plugin
      or create it yourself if one is not available.

      Finally, Forge can also be integrated in graphical IDE's opening up all its
      power to users of common platforms such as Eclipse. Come to this session if
      you want to see this powerful tool live in action!

      work.

      We will focus on examples that highlight what OpenShift has to offer, how to
      get started, & provide example projects that you can access now. Bring your
      laptop & follow along as we help you get started with Aerogears, Drools
      Planner, BRMS, Switchyard & much more. Real world projects put on display
      for you with code you can access live during this session.

      Writing documentation is already hard enough. Why do we make it more
      difficult by burying the content in an XML syntax like DocBook or wrestling
      with finicky WSYWIG editors?

      What if you could just write? Forget about the layout and styling and just
      let the thoughts flow? That's the idea behind the lightweight markup
      languages such as AsciiDoc. With AsciiDoc, the bulk of document is the
      content, embellished with subtle and intuitive semantic notations. AsciiDoc
      is designed for humans, yet machine parsable. It can even meet the most
      advanced publishing requirements.

      Come learn how to write documentation with pleasure using AsciiDoc and still
      be able to produce beautiful HTML, DocBook and PDF documentsand even
      presentation slides! Like this one.

      Static is the new dynamic. Learn how to use Awestruct to build and publish
      static websites and leverage the ever increasing capabilities of HTML5-based
      browsers to make your site more dynamic than ever before.

      Static is the new dynamic. With the ever increasing capabilities of
      HTML5-based browsers, we can give the server a rest and put security
      problems behind us by publishing static HTML5 documents and shifting the
      dynamic behavior to the client. Not only does that let you blog out of
      static hosting sites like github pages, it also means you can put more
      processing power into the author tools.

      In this session, you'll be introduced to Awestruct, a Ruby-based tool for
      building and publishing static websites. You'll discover how you can
      leverage a wide range of lightweight markup languages such as HAML, Textile,
      Markdown, SASS and CoffeeScript to keep your source terse and DRY. We'll use
      Awestruct's extension pipeline to setup a blog, add comments to your site or
      add analytic tracking scripts to your pages, then build and publish the site
      to github pages in a single command. Just because the pages are static
      doesn't mean they can't be dynamic too.

      Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, Software as a Service...
      in the world of the cloud, the user has less and less visibility into what
      is happening under the covers of his computing environment.

      What does it mean to be Free Software if you are not distributing any
      software? What is the nature of communities for cloud projects like
      OpenStack? And in a cloudy world, can people still hope to control their
      computing environments? Will the cloud kill Free Software?
